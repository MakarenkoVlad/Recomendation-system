as you mai recal implement intent ar if then plan that predetermin how you will act in a specif futur situat,procrastination
thei look like thi if happen then i will do,procrastination
you ar link a cue the if part with a desir behavior the then part,procrastination
as soon as i wake up i llimmedi get out of bed,procrastination

in the remaind of thi chapter we ll discuss why implement intent work and look at some of the scientif proof of their effect,procrastination
at the end you ll creat your person implement intent with the help of my exampl,procrastination
why do implement intent work so well it s fascin what happen in our brain when we re form these implement intent,procrastination
first a link is be creat between the cue and the desir behavior,procrastination
if you wantedto go to the gym after come home from work you d creat the follow plan as soon as i come home from work i llhead to the gym,procrastination

that s realli the beauti and eleg of thi intervent that most of it happen below your level of consciou awar,procrastination
you can be busi do other thing while your brain is scan the environ for you detect cue and guid behavior,procrastination
some peopl refer to implement intent as instant habit becaus of their automat and unconsci natur,procrastination
and just like real habit implement intent not onli unconsci and automat guid your behavior thei also impact your willpow in desir wai,procrastination
for starter theyconserv your willpow becaus you re not requir to make consciou decis when their habitu naturetak over,procrastination
preserv willpow mean there will be more left in thetank to veto the monkei to fight temptat and get donewhat need to get done,procrastination
in addit to that you re also abl to better overcom bout of low willpow,procrastination
when you automat do the right thing it doesn t matter if your willpow is deplet or not,procrastination
if you re confus about the willpow thing don t get hung up,procrastination

whenit s time to go to bed i llwrite in my gratitud journal for five minut,procrastination
carrot stick thei mai be old school,procrastination
but thei work in thi chapter we ll look at the motiv power of carrot reward and stick punish,procrastination
carrot and stick work by influenc the monkei in your brain,procrastination
as you mai recal from chapter on the monkei refer to the part of your brain that oper on a veri basic guid principl approach what feel good the carrot and avoid what feel bad the stick,procrastination
thi part of our brain is stronger in some peopl and weaker in other,procrastination
put differ some peopl ar bless with a rel quiet monkei while other ar curs with a monkei that s total out of control and basic run the show,procrastination
as procrastin we tend to have an out of control monkei,procrastination
we ll talk about long term strategi to tame the monkei and lower it impact on us in chapter,procrastination
the problem with the monkei is that it doesn t care about the futur at all,procrastination
it onli care about what feel good rightthisverymo,procrastination
the ration part of the brain would like to exercis regularli in order to live longer be healthier and have more energi in the futur,procrastination
the ration part would like to medit daili in order to reap huge emot benefit in the futur,procrastination
the ration part would like to finish task on time be product and lai the groundworkfor a success futur,procrastination
the monkei on the other hand couldn t care less about what s good for the futur,procrastination
it doesn t understand futur benefit it s onli interest in immedi gratif,procrastination
so whenev you suggest do someth that s slightli uncomfort or difficult but benefici for the futur the monkei will revolt,procrastination
it will urg you to run awai from what feel bad right nowand towardsometh that feel better right now,procrastination
that in a nutshel is why we procrastin,procrastination
now here s the good new becaus we know the monkei s basic oper principl we can influenc it by us reward carrot and punish stick,procrastination
the goal is to add immedi reward for posit activ and immedi punish for neg activ,procrastination
the more immedi the better,procrastination
instead of wait for the benefit of medit exercis or work we can make them gratifi in the short term,procrastination
instead of wait for the neg effect of procrastin we can makeourselv pai forprocrastin immedi,procrastination
in the remaind of thi chapter we ll discuss three specif idea to put thi knowledg into practic,procrastination
try thi promis yourself a rewardif you promis yourself a million dollar for finish your work project by fridai chanc ar you ll get it done by fridai if not earlier,procrastination
lucki for us smaller reward do the trick as well,procrastination
as an exampl you can promis yourself a delici protein smoothi after exercis,procrastination
you can promis yourself you ll go on a shop spreeafter finish a work project,procrastination
or you canpromis yourself you ll watch some tv after do your homework,procrastination
the kei to effect reward is to make them as immedi as possibl,procrastination
it s best if thei happen right after the desir behavior such asa protein shake and a cookieaft exercis watch an episod of game of thronesaft medit or dillyd on facebook after studi,procrastination
if you have a long project you re work on it s best to promis yourself multipl small reward for complet mileston andon bigger reward for complet the entir project,procrastination
by associ avers task with reward you infus them with some posit emot make them less appal and more attract for the monkei,procrastination
thi mean less resist and ultim less procrastin for you,procrastination
try thi bundl temptationswhil the previou strategi is all about reward yourself afterdo someth temptat bundl is all about reward yourself whiley re do it,procrastination
temptat bundl mean combin a temptat someth that feel good with someth you tend to procrastin on,procrastination
you re bundl a behavior you should do with a behavior you feel tempt to do,procrastination
thi add immedi gratif to avers task basic allow the monkei to be a lot less reluct about them,procrastination
kati milkman the inventor of thi strategi came up with thi ideadu to her own need,procrastination
here she talk about her struggl with procrastin and how temptat bundl help her get a handl on it what i realiz is that if i onli allow myself to watch my favorit tv show while exercis at the gym then i d stop wast time at home on useless televis and i d start crave trip to the gym at the end of a long dai becaus i d want to find out what happen next in my show,procrastination
and not onli that i d actual enjoi my workout and my show more combin,procrastination
i wouldn t feel guilti watch tv and time would fly while i wa at the gym,procrastination
so when i talk about temptat bundl i mean combin a temptat someth like a tv show a guilti pleasur someth that will pull you into engag in a behavior with someth you know you should do but might struggl to do,procrastination
if you want to procrastin less choos a task you tend to delai and bundl it with on of your guilti pleasur,procrastination
some common idea ar towatch tv whiley re eat a healthi meal listen to audiobook while you re exercis watch your favorit tv show while iron ordo other household chore or drink a cappuccino while work,procrastination
if you want you can go a step further and onlyindulg in the temptat when also engag in the posit behavior,procrastination
that would look as follow,procrastination
onlywatch tv while eat a healthi meal,procrastination
onlylisten to audiobook while exercis,procrastination
onlywatch your favorit tv show while iron or do other householdchor,procrastination
onlydrink cappuccino while work,procrastination
and of cours you can us temptat for multipl good behavior e,procrastination
onli watch tv when you re eat someth healthi when you re iron when you re stretch or when you re do other household chore,procrastination
the basic idea is to make a dread task a bit more entic,procrastination
when i don t feel like work for exampl i ll sometim allow myself to have anoth cup of coffe some dark chocol or anoth treat,procrastination
thi is often enough for me to break through the initi resist and just get start,procrastination
i m also a regular user of smart drug and will basic tell myself okai i m go to try thi new perform enhanc,procrastination
in return i ll work for anoth hour or two on thi project,procrastination
you re basic negoti with yourself,procrastination
and it work,procrastination
try thi make procrastin payinstead of reward yourself for get someth done carrot thi strategi is all about punish yourself for not get someth done stick,procrastination
thi approach tend to work better becaus of a concept call loss avers peopl s tendenc to prefer avoid loss to acquir equival gain,procrastination
it s better to not lose than to find,procrastination
some research suggest that loss ar twice as powerfula gain,procrastination
here s how thi tactic work you give your buddi,procrastination
if you complet your desir activ by sai p,procrastination
you get your back,procrastination

while all of these strategi tend to be us occasion rather than often clearli disrupt call ar an issu for mani peopl which thei try to do someth about,communication
final turn to the question of privaci us the strategi of phone from anoth room phone when nobodi wa home and had phone from outsid the home all the figur be higher for younger ag group,communication
privaci too is clearli an issu and a signific number of peopl develop wai to manag it,communication
that wa the s,communication
the more contemporari question is what happen when we now have mani more commun option the mobil phone and internet would be the obviou major exampl,communication
but then we must rememb that there ar on go innov and develop in relat to these technolog such as the rise of text after the mobil had alreadi start to becom a mass market and chang tariff structur for both mobil and fix line,communication
on set of question on can ask about thi expand commun repertoir concern the relationship between old and new element,communication
for exampl elsewher there ha been an attempt to explor the circumst in which new mean of commun replac or complement older on,communication
thi involv ask about the continu between new and old in that in gener we know that much of what peopl do with new option build upon past practic jouet,communication
and on can ask how we accommod new option and in gener manag a more complex repertoir,communication
for exampl how do we choos between which media to us when we want to commun haddon haddon and vincent if we take the exampl of disrupt call for some peopl at certain time we saw how even by the s peopl had alreadi develop a rang of cope strategi,communication
yet even by thi stage the innov of the answer machin had provid yet on more option on more solut to the problem,communication
despit be sold as a devic to take call when peopl were out of the home the answer machin wa also in practic wide us for filter call,communication
onc again refer back to the european studi if we take the combin figur for the countri concern us the answer machin for filter call often do thi occasion,communication
at a later stage caller id provid a relat filter option,communication
thi remand us that we need to consid not onli total new commun channel when consid the repertoir of option but also relat innov in term of new devic or servic,communication
we note earlier that in the s privaci wa sometim suffici import for some more than other that peopl were develop a rang of strategi to manag thi,communication
even by the time of the mid s european research when the mobil phone wa still not so widespread of interviewe were alreadi acknowledg that the mobil phone wa sometim us precis becaus it enabl such privaci haddon,communication
inde subsequ research specif on youth show how the mobil enabl young peopl to avoid parent monitor of their call ling and helmersen ling,communication
the same point could be made in relat to other problem identifi in the s,communication
for exampl the mobil phone and later broadband offer more than on line both help overcom the problem of on household member block the singl household line with their call,communication
in some household parent get children to pai for their own pre paid card for their mobil wa on wai of avoid argument about the cost of the call thei made ling and helmersen,communication
while the abov exampl ar us to illustr the main point that new element in the repertoir can offer solut to older problem thi is inevit also a simplif,communication
let us return to the exampl of the answer machin,communication
thei themselv could constitut a new problem or at least an irrit for caller who did not like to deal with them,communication
sometim the knowledg that filter wa an option could creat the suspicion that the peopl be call were hide behind their machin and could lead to verbal attempt to persuad them to pick up the phone,communication
convers other caller learnt to expect answer machin and were at eas with asynchron commun,communication
sometim thei even prefer thi phone a fix line when thei anticip the person will be out and occasion thei were surpris when and unprepar when the peopl call were unexpectedli present,communication
in other word while a new option mai address an old problem at on level it can in turn lead to a whole new set of interact issu or strategi,communication
in addit to solv old problem new option also transform the issu to be manag,communication
for exampl in the s we saw how there wa evid of some concern or at least wari about the potenti or actual size of phone bill with exampl of parent especi try to ration children s us of the phone,communication
a recent british small scale studi haddon and vincent suggest that thi underlin concern with telecom cost wa still present,communication
howev the uk tariff option were far differ by now with a host of mobil phone and even fix line tariff packag offer flat rate tariff either for certain time or all the time,communication
henc some household in that studi that had move to flat rate fix line call,communication
thi meant that the question of ration wa no longer so relev if there were no extra cost incur in make addit call,communication
howev there we still effort to persuad hildren for exampl to us the fix line in the first place rather than other channel such as the mobil phone sinc that could incur further cost per call,communication
or if the tariff wa such that flat rate appli to the fix line or mobil after a certain time then children and other adult were sometim persuad to steer their call to those time when call were regard as be effect free,communication
moreov some of the discuss about how best to keep down telecommun cost aros not onli when particular call were made or more often when bill arriv but also when negoti which oper and tariff arrang to have in the first place or decid whether to chang these,communication
to summaris the problem of telecommun cost mai still be present it ha not necessarili disappear but the detail of it manag and the natur of the search for solut can chang,communication
new commun option can also give rise to new problem new thing to be manag,communication
a british studi of a dai in the life of famili and their commun choic start to show some of the new frustrat or irrit emerg as telecom option have grown,communication
for exampl it wa increasingli common for caller try on channel such as the fix line and then anoth on when the first fail or is occupi,communication
howev thi sometim could happen too quickli or els precis becaus the person wa engag in on call thei did not want to be contact through anoth channel,communication
appropri behaviour in these case had not yet been work out,communication
meanwhil the sheer increas in commun that sometim follow from have more channel could be overwhelm turn specif to the mobil phone variou studi have look at how the mobil can be perceiv as be disrupt in differ public space,communication
thi ha given rise to observ about how user manag the relationship to co present other when thei ar call be that peopl thei ar with or just other in the vicin as well as with the interlocutor e,communication
ling fortunati,communication
for exampl when do thei go off to on side when do the indic to other that the call will not be long,communication
thei now have to think about how to manag relat with the interlocutor in those situat perhap indic the situat and the time that thei can spend on the call,communication
meanwhil wow peopl control and manag their avail on the mobil is issu peopl now have to think about develop polici about who thei give the mobil number out to and strategi about when thei switch the phone on and how thei deal with particular call answer immedi or send it to voic mail licopp and heurtin,communication
there have been variou issu relat to text on the mobil phone thi time with problem aris sometim in relat to peer in social network,communication
on such issu is when it is or is not appropri to manag commun by text at all as oppos to some other channel or face to face e,communication
when end a relationship with a boi or girlfriend,communication
anoth problem to be manag wa deal with expect about how quickli to return the gift of a text messag taylor and harper although thi could also appli to expect regard repli to phone messag or email,communication
and return to intrafamili relat and anoth exampl from the british studi on teenag caus great anxieti at home and immedi phone call back from hi parent when he sent a text back from a holidai abroad just mention that there had been some problem,communication
thi illustr the more gener issu of when it is appropri to send a text about what topic and the consequ of do so,communication
similar question have also been rais about the appropri of some email not so much spam but from and to known social network,communication
thi had led some to comment on how thi medium is still rel immatur when it can lead to unnecessari email almost like spam when on can be overwhelm email that find their wai to the wrong peopl or email that creat misunderstand,communication
onc again peopl have start to develop strategi for deal with all of these potenti or actual problem although some still remain frustrat by some of these problem,communication
the veri start of thi chapter note that understand commun problem could throw some light on telecommun behaviour,communication
clearli the exampl provid abov illustr factor shape the call peopl ar will to make if there ar sometim interperson pressur to limit call as well as to receiv if some ar disrupt,communication
the exampl show why some call ar made at certain time in certain place if we consid the privaci discuss and as our option increas through on channel or commun mode rather than anoth e,communication
fix line vs,communication
mobil voic vs,communication
text etc,communication
the open statement also suggest that thi wa on factor albeit onli on of relev for understand adopt of new channel and option and we can now add amount of their us,communication
thi is import for the develop of new ict and servic,communication
there is a tradit in the telecom industri albeit slightli chang now of look at user need,communication
perhap in part thi might be conceptualis as problem user experi consid not just usabl challeng but some of the more social interperson issu describ in thi chapter,communication
mayb reflect upon actual and potenti problem of the kind describ here might help to creat opportun for new product and servic or at least avoid aggreg exist tension or creat,communication
thi section reflect work current be undertaken for the oxford internet institut by the author involv interview with peopl about their experi of email new dilemma,communication
more gener while telecom compani would desir us to consum ever more of their product some of these exampl have shown the tension creat by the cost of the current level of telecom usag,communication
when e turn to the social consequ of what for mani peopl is an expand commun repertoir onc again we can start to approach thi by ask how much ani problem have chang,communication
have some been solv have thei been transform or do new commun option lead to new and possibl more substanti problem,communication
often when we ask about social consequ the question is on of how much ha stai the same how much ha chang and is that chang rel superfici or more signific in these exampl we see thi type of question can be ask of negoti around the cost of telecom it remain an underli issu but clearli some of the discuss and decis within household ar differ from the s situat outlin earlier,communication
to finish and stand back from all these particular exampl we can pose the more gener question of why someth is felt to be a problem or why someth had to be manag,communication
what expect exist where do these come from is some behaviour infring norm that exist befor new telecom option such question have been pose in relat to some problem with the mobil e,communication
ling ling et al but thei need to be ask more gener of each new medium or innov,communication
second we need to pose the question of how much of the wai we manag our commun repertoir is settl andw persuad peopl everi dai whether it s get our children to follow their time schedul ask a colleagu to help with a project or convinc our farmer to adopt improv product technolog or adopt new market strategi,communication
persuas is commun with a purpos to caus a person or group to adopt as their own a product person idea entiti or point of view that the person would otherwis not support,communication
to put it more simpli persuas is go beyond pleas,communication
to be persuas you have to establish a common bond between yourself and the person you ar try to influenc,communication
thi bond often call common ground come from share experi understand cue and mean,communication
the languag we us and the wai we commun ar central to thi bond process,communication
word convei mean emot and feel,communication
all word ar not creat equal howev some word evok more emot in listen and as such thei ar more power and henc persuas,communication
persuas is underneath the umbrella term of influenc,communication
in other word persuas is influenc but it requir commun wherea influenc doesn t necessarili,communication
persuas can attempt to influenc the belief attitud intent motiv or behavior,communication
persuas is a process aim at chang a person s or a group s attitud or behavior toward some event idea object or other person s by us written or spoken word to convei inform feel or reason or a combin thereof wikipedia,communication
effect persuas is a process which involv negoti and learn through which a persuad lead colleagu to a problem s share solut,communication

he us exampl of be abl to sai no and commun when not feel well everi child should have that power,communication
malcolm us practic exampl throughout the present to emphas the import of commun well for children on the spectrum,communication
in thi articl we will look at the reason behind commun problem for peopl with an autism spectrum disord asd,communication
we will also share possibl wai to improv commun with your child on the spectrum includ nonverb children,communication
even though long term studi ar lack in thi field conclus from relev studi and research will be discuss to illustr the effect of intervent to improv commun for children with asd,communication
the struggl mai be their realiti,communication
for children with autism it mai feel like the deck is stack against them,communication
for starter a convers usual begin non verbal with ey contact someth mani peopl with autism struggl with,communication
if the child is older hi her languag skill mai be test when the verbal part of social commun commenc with greet and small talk social niceti he she mai not get,communication
other nuanc element of social interact and commun like tone of voic facial express and appropri gestur mai come natur to neurotyp individu but for those with autism spectrum disord these commun skill mai have to be learn,communication
when it come to languag skill some children with asd ar actual ahead of their neurotyp peer,communication
these children mai possess a vocabulari beyond their year or us languag in a formal almost busi like manner,communication
often these children ar skill at memor the rule of languag thei mai therefor be particularli good at spell and learn new word,communication
howev the applic and everydai us of languag for social interact could be challeng for them,communication
speech therapist and autism profession us the term pragmat commun to refer to the wai languag is us to commun rather than the wai it is structur ciccia,communication
in other word it s the wai we us languag in the appropri wai dure differ social interact,communication
in the present refer to earlier dr,communication
malcolm refer to pragmat as social languag,communication
accord to bate pragmat includ three main domain,communication
commun function,communication
discours skill,communication
presupposit,communication
us languag which is appropri for a specif context goe beyond memoris grammat rule and acquir vocabulari the abstract natur of pragmat includ make assumpt us the correct languag for a given situat and chang languag accord to the need of the listen,communication
imagin have to get all those element in place just to have a simpl social interact no wonder it is challeng for adult and even more so for children with asd,communication
adult and children on the spectrum vari immens in the wai thei talk and interact the veri natur of a spectrum disord mean it s possibl for some individu to have savant like languag skill while other ar nonverb,communication
there ar howev certain characterist which have been identifi as common to the commun style of children on the autism spectrum,communication
how do children with autism commun children with asd often have veri specif interest thei mai like to talk about such an interest at great length without regard for their listen or social situat,communication
turn take and ask about the other person s interest mai simpli not occur to them,communication
social cue ar often miss,communication
thei mai also speak in a manner which is view as differ to the norm by neurotyp individu thi could includ talk in a sing song or high pitch voic quot excerpt from movi not relat to the convers or repeat the same phrase over and over again,communication
children on the spectrum mai also not grasp the sensit of their audienc to certain topic and thei mai speak about thing regard as inappropri or taboo for gener convers,communication
their difficulti with pragmat languag mai be challeng for parent who want their children to experi posit social interact with peer,communication
it s import to consid just how difficult it must be to partak in someth where the rule ar never the same and no on can explain precis what to expect from each new commun encount,communication
then we realiz just how much empathi and understand children with asd need when it come to commun,communication
improv commun,communication
everi child should be abl to commun in some capac and thei should not be depriv of thi right becaus thei don t us speech,communication
teach nonverb skill to commun can sometim lead to verbal commun the child who is abl to commun a need or control hi her environ mai have the motiv to improv commun by verbal need,communication
in a studi paul review program aim at languag develop in high function children with asd the import of shift the focu from word and sentenc to the social function of commun when develop intervent wa emphasis,communication
the studi also detail development base social pragmat strategi to facilit improv commun even for nonverb children,communication
the idea of thi approach is to begin by us nonverb form of commun to form a bridg to actual speech,communication
some central idea of thi approach includ paul the child set the attent tone and make the choic regard materi,communication
give children with asd intensifi opportun to particip in activ similar to those their neurotyp peer engag in thi is seen as the most effect context for improv and learn commun skill us teachabl moment occur natur dure interact especi in the cours of daili activ like meal time,communication
set function goal for commun,communication
the target behavior should be taught and practic to be applic to the child s daili activ in a meaning wai teach the prerequisit role of nonverb commun to social interact by emphasis the import of ey contact bodi languag and gestur to develop social languag help your nonverb child commun,communication
a child s commun need should be met whether he she choos to verbal their need or not,communication
nonverb children should be help to commun in a wai that make them feel heard,communication
more studi ar need to establish the most benefici wai of commun with a nonverb child some idea includ paul sign languag could be an effect wai to commun with a nonverb child with autism,communication
research doe not necessarili suggest sign languag as a path to further languag develop but it could be the tool a parent need to commun with their child while verbal skill ar acquir draw and pictur exchang commun system pec ar effect teach tool becaus thei reli on the child initi the commun exchang,communication
the child begin the interact by choos or draw a pictur which he she hand to an adult in exchang for a desir object,communication
in thi wai singl word request ar taught to the autist child,communication
commun board and cue card ar help for nonverb children and can support verbal children in stress situat technolog can be incorpor to teach a comprehens visual languag to children us pictur symbol and video clip on electron devic accord to shane and weiss kapp some studi have also note success with peer train program parent of nonverb children with autism mai worri extens about whether their child is abl to commun hi her need,communication
it is therefor encourag to observ result from studi wodka et al indic that non verbal children can acquir verbal skill later with some reach encourag level of fluenci in adolesc,communication
if your child is verbal but lack pragmat or social skill and you want to help him her commun better the follow suggest mai be help if you re not on the spectrum rememb your child with autism might not possess the natur understand of languag and social interact neurotyp individu take for grant,communication
approach commun from hi her perspect and help him her progress from their own start point it mai be help to orchestr intensifi commun learn situat with peer where your child can practic function commun skill allow your child opportun to commun,communication
as parent we want to give our kid everyth thei need and as we anticip need we often depriv them of the opportun to commun their actual need,communication
want or need someth provid an excel opportun for your child to commun negoti and practic verbal and non verbal skill the same goe for share of interest,communication
even though parent mai be frustrat by their child s monologu involv their current interest it mai creat an opportun to teach your child about turn take and ask about other interest in convers be care of over train a child when it come to social commun,communication
a child who s been instruct to memoris commun content for specif social situat mai sound robot,communication

all particip have given their oral inform consent to record and for the record to be us for research purpos,communication
the swedish law fs and the swedish research council do not demand approv from extern ethic committe in case of particip observ,communication
in read the transcript we have search for sequenc that have been character by disagr and through sequenti analysi have identifi differ wai in which disagr is initi and address in the convers,communication
we have us a definit of disagr that mainli refer to disagr after the third turn,communication
thi refer to situat where an interlocutor make a claim or propos that is contradict in a statement perform by anoth interlocutor and the first speaker maintain or defend the origin,communication
howev we have not limit ourselv to disagr after the third turn but have also analyz sequenc with subtler marker for disagr,communication
the theoret point of departur of thi analysi is social construction and interaction and thi analysi see social situat and structur as be accomplish and perform intersubject through social interact,communication
disagr is not just a frame for convers nor a consequ of convers but disagr is made through interact henc it matter how disagr is carri out,communication
an import concept for understand how disagr ar handl in convers is constitut expect the intersubject expect interlocutor share about the content and form of convers,communication
garfinkel demonstr in a seri of classic experi that when a convers particip violat intersubject expect it will lead to doubt about intersubject and doubt that commun is at all possibl,communication
thi will subsequ result in a commun breakdown follow by the reconstruct of new more suspici constitut expect,communication
in order to avoid a convers end in a breach of constitut expect the daili repertoir ha tool for detect as well as repair misunderstand that could lead to violat of constitut expect,communication
although we have a social constructivist focu and see sequenti organ of convers as an import piec of the puzzl for understand the prerequisit for agonist dialogu in natur resourc conflict we have chosen not to conduct a regular convers analysi accord to the transcript convent develop,communication
our transcript have been made in swedish and indic the word we can hear pronounc but not the phonet or detail in the interact,communication
the reason we have not done so is that we judg that we did not need that level of detail and dissolut in our analysi,communication
the translat of quot from swedish to english ha been done after the analysi,communication
the institut context of wildlif disagr and norm dialogu the purpos of thi studi is to discuss the commun condit for agonist dialogu in the field of natur resourc manag by analyz how disagr ar interact achiev in meet organ with the explicit aim of deal with conflict and paradox goal through dialogu,communication
we have no explicit ambit to explain the caus the develop and the consequ of these conflict situat but onli to show how disagr ar made in the current convers,communication
howev these convers take place in situat of quit high contextu densiti,communication
schegloff suggest that the context of talk in interact is defin through and in talk in interact when the particip in these convers relat to the context,communication
with a social constructivist perspect context is situat and emerg,communication
schegloff stress that the analyst need to understand the particip endogen orient toward their context through pai attent to refer to the context creat in talk in interact and how thi context is made meaning in the interact,communication
thi is import otherwis the analyst risk impos their interpret of a context on the situat and it particip,communication
we agre with schegloff s argument for take local and interact produc perspect on context serious,communication
howev we also think that in the kind of complex context that we ar analyz the convers particip refer to layer and layer of mean and it becom veri difficult for an outsid to understand the refer to context made in the turn and how thei relat to refer in other turn without a preunderstand of the interact histori,communication
therefor we think that the analyst also need to take into consider other sourc to context than the local talk in interact,communication
therefor we will provid some of our understand of the context of these situat and discuss some institut and contextu factor that we believ ar import for the understand of what transpir dure these convers,communication
thi is not about intrud on particip endogen orient toward context it is about provid enough intersubject to make the particip refer to context visibl for the analyst and the reader of the analysi,communication

we will for the sake of simplic label these case reindeer predat and agricultur crane,communication
thi wai of describ what the particip in the observ convers ar talk about is of cours a mislead simplif and gener and it could be describ in quit differ wai,communication
it is not predat reindeer and bird and their respect need that ar at the center of the convers but peopl and their expect worri and relationship,communication
nevertheless we will devot some space to describ reindeer husbandri predat graze bird and farm the relationship among them and the polici that regul their prerequisit,communication
six wai to not perform disagr in our materi we found sequenc in which what we call third turn disagr wa perform as well as sequenc with other less clear marker for disagr,communication
in some case it appear to us as extern viewer with knowledg of the overal contextu condit as if a convers partner tri to initi an incompat which for differ reason wa not interact constitut as a third turn disagr,communication
howev in either third turn disagr or in the less explicit initi of disagr the disagr wa not maintain after the fourth fifth or nth turn,communication
in fact we could not find ani exampl of situat where more fundament differ in epistemolog ontolog ethic axiolog or meta commun posit were express or where the actor address the power relationship that hid the disagr,communication
instead we identifi in our materi six differ type of procedur for not maintain disagr which were collabor appli by particip,communication
the disagr is initi and articul as disagr after third turn but reconstruct in the nth turn into consensu or creativ problem solv after argument persuas compuls or manipul,communication
the disagr is initi as disagr after third turn but interrupt and postpon after the second third or nth turn,communication
particip deploi joke as indic but not perform of disagr,communication
question ar us as proxi for initi of disagr but not treat as disagr after the first turn,communication
equivoc initi of disagr lead to doubt about intersubject,communication
disagr appear as a meta discurs object but is not perform,communication
we will develop how these type of not perform not maintain and un complet disagr work with the help of exampl from our materi,communication

empath abil is the aptitud of the psychotherapist for notic the pain of other,selfCare
the model suggest that without empathi there will be littl if ani compass stress and no compass fatigu,selfCare
howev without empathi there will be littl if ani empath respons to the suffer client,selfCare
thu the abil to empath is a keyston both to help other and be vulner to the cost of care,selfCare
empath concern is the motiv to respond to peopl in need,selfCare
the abil to be empath is insuffici unless there is motiv to help other who requir the servic of a concern psychotherapist,selfCare
with suffici concern the empath psychotherapist draw upon her or hi talent train and knowledg to deliv the highest qualiti of servic possibl to those who seek it,selfCare
exposur to the client is experienc the emot energi of the suffer of cli ent through direct exposur,selfCare
on of the reason why those in direct practic of human servic becom supervisor administr or teacher in mental health profess is due directli to the cost of direct exposur to client,selfCare
some make the shift for direct practic becaus of addit pai improv work condit and higher statu,selfCare
how ever the cost of direct exposur to the suffer of other is high and it is imposs to know how mani have chosen to abandon direct practic becaus the price wa too high for them,selfCare
empath respons is the extent to which the psychotherapist make an effort to reduc the suffer of the suffer through empath understand,selfCare
thi insight into feel thought and behavior of the client is achiev by project on s self into the perspect of the client,selfCare
in do so the psychotherapist might experi the hurt fear anger or other emot experienc by the client,selfCare
therein lie both the benefit and the cost of such a power therapeut respons,selfCare
the benefit ar immedi obviou to everi graduat student who practic her or hi new skill with anoth,selfCare
the cost ar rare discuss and must be experienc to elicit effort on the part of the psychoth apist to guard against or mitig the effect on the self,selfCare
compass stress is the residu of emot energi from the empath respons to the client and is the on go demand for action to reliev the suffer of a client,selfCare
like ani stress with suffici intens it can have a neg impact on the human immun system and the qualiti of life in gener,selfCare
togeth with other factor it can contribut to compass fatigu unless the psychotherapist act to control compass stress,selfCare
there appear to be two major set of cope action that can do thi,selfCare
sens of achiev is on factor that lower or prevent compass stress and is the extent to which the psychotherapist is satisfi with hi or her effort to help the client,selfCare
a psychotherapist with a sens of achiev regard the deliveri of servic to the client demand a consciou ration effort to recogn where the psychothera pist respons end and the client s respons begin,selfCare
disengag is the other factor that lower or prevent compass stress,selfCare
it is the extent to which the psychotherapist can distanc himself or herself from the ongo miseri of the client between session in which servic ar be deliv,selfCare
a psycho therapist s abil to disengag the client also demand a consciou ration effort to recogn that she or he must let go of the thought feel and sensat associ with the session with the client in order to live their own life,selfCare
disengag is the recognit on the part of the psychotherapist for import of self care and to carri out a deliber program of self care,selfCare
if compass stress is permit to build despit the psychotherapist s effort at disengag and a sens of work satisfact the psychotherapist is at a greater risk of compass fatigu,selfCare
three other factor plai a role in increas compass fatigu,selfCare
prolong exposur is the ongo sens of respons for the care of the suffer ing over a protract period of time,selfCare
the longer the period of time between break the better at least a dai of appoint and as much as a week s vacat,selfCare
these break ar specif view as such a respit from be compassion and empath toward client a break from be a profession servic provid,selfCare
traumat recollect ar memori that trigger the symptom of ptsd and asso ciat reaction such as depress and anxieti,selfCare
these memori mai be from the psy chotherapist s experi with other rather demand or threaten client or client who were especi sad or suffer,selfCare
these memori ar event that when recal caus an emot reaction,selfCare
these memori can be provok by certain type of client and client experi that have a connect to the traumat event experienc by the therapist,selfCare
life disrupt is the unexpect chang in schedul routin and manag life respons that demand attent e,selfCare
ill chang in life style social statu or profession or person respons,selfCare
normal such disrupt would caus a cer tain but toler level of distress,selfCare
howev when combin with the other seven factor these disrupt can increas the chanc of the therapist develop compass fatigu,selfCare
just as thi model of compass fatigu can help to predict it onset the model can also help in prevent and mitig thi fatigu,selfCare
with doc or jane or ani psychotherapist who work with the suffer there ar five implic deriv from thi model to do so,selfCare
first if it is clear that the therapist ha compass fatigu provid a comprehen sive overview of compass fatigu for educ purpos is vital,selfCare
a copi of thi articl could be the first step,selfCare
the therapist can find more on the web at the librari and in profession journal such as profession psycholog,selfCare
second it is import to desensit the therapist to traumat stressor,selfCare
in do so she or he ha greater abil to face and work through the variou issu associ with caus and retain the traumat stress reaction,selfCare
the method for desensit psychotherapist ar no differ that those for other traumat client,selfCare
there should be a good match between the prefer of the therapist client and the desensit method util by the treat therapist,selfCare
the method should minim the degre of discomfort and should maxim the exposur to the stimuli which most account for the distress reaction,selfCare
the result of such method of cours should substanti decreas or elimi nate the unwant emot reactiv link to the traumat stressor s,selfCare
in jane s case it wa femal client disclosur about their mother particularli a sens of responsibil iti or a fear for safeti,selfCare
in doc s case it wa ani remind of the war and especi war casualti,selfCare
the third issu is associ with exposur dosag,selfCare
there is consider evid that the primari activ ingredi in effect desensit is exposur figlei b,selfCare
util the right therapeut dosag of exposur is challeng,selfCare
on effect method is to combin exposur with relax therebi activ the reciproc inhibit reflex,selfCare
a number of treatment method ar effect primarili becaus of thi reflex figlei b,selfCare
a fourth issu in treat compass fatigu is assess and enhanc social sup port,selfCare
psychotherapist gradual view themselv as other view them someon who is an expert at help other cope with life s challeng,selfCare
thei seem to forget that thei ar human be as well,selfCare
a physician sometim get sick and need anoth physician s servic for exampl,selfCare
often the therapist ha a rather limit social support system com pose of colleagu and onli a few intim relationship,selfCare
it is vital to increas the therapist s support system in both number and varieti of relationship so that she or he is view apart from the therapist persona,selfCare
moreov some relationship mai be a sourc of strain and stress,selfCare
these toxic relationship ar an addit demand and should be address figlei,selfCare
in return to jane s case we quickli move in the initi interview to jane s feel of guilt about her mother s condit and her inabl to address her ambival toward confront her dysfunct relationship with her mother,selfCare
after the first session jane complet a batteri of test includ the purdu social support scale burg figlei figlei the compass fatigu self test figlei stamm figlei stamm and a measur of ptsd,selfCare
she also complet a structur clinic interview to determin her current relationship with her mother and the degre of system enmesh,selfCare
her result confirm our jane and the treat team s assess that she wa suffer from compass fatigu a restrict social support network and from consider traumat stress,selfCare
but rather than be the classic struggl between mother and daughter it becam obviou that there wa some secret she had not disclos yet,selfCare
thi secret wa the fact that her mother wa attack by a dog and nearli kill,selfCare
dure the next session we share the result with jane discuss the treatment option and agre upon a treatment plan,selfCare
the plan entail increas her self sooth and stress manag skill e,selfCare
workbook video train enhanc the number and varieti of social support e,selfCare
through volunt work and involv in extra curricular activ and util cognit behavior therapi that minim exposur and clinic time that would result in desensit i,selfCare
reduct or elimin of traumat stress,selfCare
she select the ey movement desensit and reprocess emdr as the method for address the secondari traumat stress associ with her own experi that were affect her effect as a profession,selfCare
emdr proce dure call for the client to select a target memori that repres the worst and most stress aspect of the trauma,selfCare
she select the dog attack as the initi experi,selfCare
as an indic of success we would us the same case materi she us in class the young femal colleg student adjust to be awai and feel guilti about leav her mother,selfCare
for the next five session us emdr jane work through the dog attack the first sign of her mother s chronic ill jane s sacrific feel of resent toward her mother and the embarrass she felt particularli dure her teenag year have to take care of her mother,selfCare
by the final session jane s symptom subsid desensit,selfCare
she shift from self blame and self hatr to a more realist view of herself and her mother,selfCare
discu sion about the clinic case she found challeng were now interest but rather routin,selfCare
jane recogn that she still ha work to do,selfCare
she still is reactiv around her mother and know that patienc and practic ar necessari to be fulli differenti from her mother emotion and as a result it will be easier to love and appreci her,selfCare
her test score show signific reduct in symptom preval and inten siti confirm what we could see ourselv,selfCare
at our request she check in with us period,selfCare
after more than a year she is thrive in both her own practic and her person life,selfCare
there ar thing that we can do to help our colleagu who work with client with chronic ill,selfCare
the first is to speak openli about our own struggl with compass stress and compass fatigu,selfCare
the conspiraci of silenc among the profess about thi compa sion fatigu is no differ than the silenc about famili violenc racism and sexual harass in the past,selfCare

in jane s case and with other psychotherapist experienc compass fatigu burnout it is vital to be abl to gain masteri of distress,selfCare
thi is true dure session when work directli with client or outsid the session in the privaci of on s offic automobil or home,selfCare
the psychotherapist also need wai to desensit from distress memori mem ori that invok traumat stress symptom and ar the hallmark of compass fatigu,selfCare
most often the psychotherapist need the servic of anoth to effect treat thi through some type of desensit program,selfCare
it is vital that todai s psychotherapist continu to work with empathi and compass,selfCare
yet there is a cost to thi work that is obviou to ani on practition work with the suffer,selfCare
as the evid mount prove the neg consequ of a lack of self care and the presenc of compass fatigu so will the ethic imper for the suf fere practition to do someth or someth will be done for them,selfCare
we cannot afford to not attend to the mistak misjudg and blatant clinic error of psychothera pist who suffer from compass fatigu,selfCare
it is therefor up to all of us to elev these issu to a greater level of awar in the help profess,selfCare
